<p>The attention of persons interested in Walt Whitman
is directed to <i>The Conservator</i>, in which,
along with the presentation of other views, affecting
freedom, democracy, ethics, solidarity, there appear
special studies treating of the significance of Walt
Whitman’s appearance in history, written in part by
men whose personal relations to Whitman, often
whose genius, give their utterances great importance
and offer special reasons why readers of books and
lovers of man cannot afford to ignore or neglect their
contributions.</p>

<p>Those authors and subjects that many
readers are glad to come at in a brief
way, (and who may be thereby quickened to
direct their studies anew to the sometimes
surface hidden beauties of literature,) will continue
to find ample presentation in <i>The Bibelot</i>
for 1896.</p>

<p>The typework that has made so many
friends among bookmen, will also be fully
sustained; in a word, <i>The Bibelot</i> still proposes
to remain something quite by itself, and out
of the highway and beaten track of every-day
book-making.</p>

<p>Subscriptions for 1896 at the regular
price, 50 cents in advance, postpaid, are
taken for the complete year only. After
March 1, the rate will be 75 cents, which will,
on completion of Volume II, be advanced to
$1.00 net.</p>

<p>It is desirable that <span class="smcap">renewals</span> for 1896
should be forwarded Mr. Mosher <i>early</i> that
no vexatious delays may occur in mailing.
All subscriptions must begin with January
and end with December of each year.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/deco4.jpg" width="35" height="30" alt="">
</div>

<p>Meditations in Motley reveals a new American
essayist, honest and whimsical, with a good deal of
decorative plain speaking. An occasional carelessness
of style is redeemed by unfailing insight.—I.
Zangwill in <i>The Pall Mall Magazine</i> for April, 1895.</p>

<p>Philip Hale, the well-known and brilliant literary
and musical critic, writes: “Walter Blackburn
Harte is beyond doubt and peradventure, the leading
essayist in Boston to-day. For Boston, perhaps you
had better read “The United States.” His matter is
original and brave, his style is clear, polished when
effect is to be gained thereby, blunt when the blow
should fall, and at times delightfully whimsical,
rambling, paradoxical, fantastical.”</p>

<p>Mr. Harte is not always so good in the piece as in
the pattern, but he is a pleasant companion, and I
have met with no volume of essays from America
since Miss Agnes Repplier’s so good as his Meditations
in Motley.—<span class="smcap">Richard Le Gallienne</span>, in the
London <i>Review</i>.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Some years ago at College I read, on compulsion,
a book on Rhetoric. Reasons were to
me then as plenty as blackberries, and I recollect
that on examination my answers given to this, that,
and the other were so glib and trite, and my thesis
so amusing, that I carried off a Prize.</p>

<p>But during the struggle for prizes that have a value
as collateral, the Prize and the Rhetoric were forgotten.
Yet Fate decreed it so, and one day last week
I met a Harvard youth, whose ambition was Literature,
and he was in the grinding turmoil of a Volume.
He was studying on compulsion, with intent to work
off a Condition, and the book he was reading with
such violence was the Rhetoric of my College days.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
With a flush of pride it came to me that I was a Prizeman,
and I offered, out of the goodness of my heart,
to tutor the youth, so that after five lessons of an
hour each he could grind the Condition to powder.</p>

<p>To prove my fitness, the young man put me through
a slight quiz, and alas! all of the beautiful truths and
facts of the Rhetoric had slipped me, save this alone:
“The three requisites in correct writing are Clearness,
Force, and Elegance.”</p>

<p>Every address that Professor Adams Sherman Hill,
who wrote the Rhetoric, ever gave began with this
formula. Mr. Barrett Wendell, Heir-Apparent to
his ideas and Chair, does the same; and the Shock-headed
Youth, who occupies the same relation to the
professorship that the infant Duke of York does to
the throne of England, always settles himself in his
seat with his elbows on the table, coughs gently, and
prefaces his lecture by saying to the admiring Freshmen:
“Gentlemen, the three requisites in correct
writing are Clearness, Force, and Elegance.” Professor
Hill has in one book, by actual count, twenty-seven
different propositions that he divides into three
parts. I have forgotten them all save the one just
named. This statement I never can forget. I hold
it with a deathless grasp that defies the seasons and
sorrows of time: for there are things burned so deep
into one’s soul that the brand can never be removed;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
and should reason abdicate, I’ll gibber through the
grates of my padded cell at each pitying passer-by,
“The three requisites in correct writing are Clearness,
Force, and Elegance.”</p>

<p>For years I have repeated this fetching formula on
every possible occasion; and up to this date I have
managed to drown the rising voice of conscience by
the specious plea that a double standard of truth is
justifiable in the present condition of society. In
morals I have been a bimetalist.</p>

<p>But after reading <i>On Compromise</i>, by John Morley,
I am convinced that this juggling with the Eternal
Verities is what has kept the race in darkness these
many cycles; and I now admit the truth which I
have long withheld, that Professor Hill’s three Requisites
are gross humbuggery. I boldly state that
Professor Hill does not know what the “Requisites”
are; and I am sure that I do not. In fact I am looking
for them anxiously; and should I ever find them,
I’ll do as Shakespeare did—keep them to myself. I
say further that inasmuch as Professor Hill does not
know them, the Heir-Apparent and the Shock-headed
Youth in the rush-line for the Chair cannot possibly
be expected to know: so none of us know.</p>

<p>Not only is Professor Hill’s formula rank error,
but it is in direct opposition to truth. I bundle his
crass creed with Dr. Hall’s Universal Self-Treatment,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
Professor Loisette’s Scheme of Mnemonics, and the
Brown-Sequard Recipe for Perpetual Youth.</p>

<p>Professor Hill, with the help of his students, has
compiled three books on Rhetoric; Mr. Barrett
Wendell has published two. Students at Harvard
are expected to buy these books. There are three
thousand students at Harvard. These various books
are practically one, for they all teach that “a parenthetical
remark must be enclosed in parentheses,
dashes or commas,” and that “every sentence should
have at least one verb.” These things are explained
to men who have had ten years of solid schooling in
order to fit them for College. Professor Hill recommends
Harvard students to buy “that well written
work on Composition by Mr. Barrett Wendell,” and
Mr. Wendell modestly says, on page 8, line 18, of
his biggest well written work: “Professor Hill’s
books are the most sensible treatment of the art of
composition that I have yet found in print.” The
last three chapters in Mr. Wendell’s well written
work bear the following startling titles, respectively:
<i>Clearness</i>, <i>Force</i>, and <i>Elegance</i>. Harvard Freshmen
know Trigonometry, Physics and “one language beside
English,” and various other things, but it is left
for Professor Hill to sell them a book which explains
that “a sentence may end either with a period, interrogation
point or an exclamation mark!” Do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
you say that the public school system is to blame
for such a condition? My answer is that if Harvard
required her students to know the simple rules
of Rhetoric before being admitted to the University,
it would be done.</p>

<p>Mr. Hill fills the Boylston Professorship of Literature
and Oratory at Harvard University, but with all
the many thousand students who have been under his
care he has probably never given impulse to a single
orator, nor materially assisted one man with literary
ambition. The reason is that he is teaching things
that should have been known to his pupils years before.
There is a time to teach things as well as a
way. Instead of arousing animation Professor Hill
reduces it. So sympathy is made a weakling and
imagination rendered wingless. I have examined
many compositions written by Harvard students, and
they average up about like the epistles of little girls
who write letters to Santa Claus. The students are
all right—fine intelligent young fellows—but the conditions
under which they work are such that they are
robbed of all spontaneity when they attempt to express
themselves. Of course I know that a few Harvard
men have succeeded in Oratory and Literature,
for there are those so strong that even Cambridge
cannot kill their personality, nor a Professor reduce
to neutral salts their native vim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span></p>

<p>The rules of Rhetoric should be taught to adolescence;
then when the boy goes to college he has
tools with which to work. “When did you learn
your letters?” I asked a six-year-old youngster yesterday.
“I allus know’d ’em,” was the reply. And
the answer was wise, for the kindergarten methods
teach the child to read, and he never knows when or
how he acquired the knowledge. As a healthy man
does not know he has a stomach, so he should write
without knowing a single so-called rule. And as the
Froebel methods are fast making their way in all departments
of learning, I expect this will soon be so.
But the colleges lag behind, and Harvard (very busy
fighting “Co-Ed—”) still tries to make statues by
clapping the material on the outside.</p>

<p>Professor Hill knows the futility of his methods,
for in his last work he puts in several disclaimers to
the effect that he “does not undertake to supply men
with ideas.” That confession of weakness is pitiful.
Professor Hill should surround his students with an
atmosphere that makes thought possible. By liberating
the imagination of his pupils ideas would come
to them. But as fire will not burn without oxygen,
so thought cannot exist in the presence of Mr. Barrett
Wendell. Both he and his Superior are strong
in way of supplying cold storage—that’s all.</p>

<p>In lecturing on Literature and Oratory these men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
sit at a desk. And often, becoming weary, they
sprawl over the table like a devil-fish seeking its prey.
This, I believe, is the usual Cambridge method. But
there is one exception to this rule at Harvard, and
that is Professor Kittredge, who being nervous and
cannot sit still, paces the platform and shoots the
lecture over his shoulder. When a student is called
on to recite, Professor Kittredge often opens a box
of withering sarcasm that acts like chlorine gas on
the poor fellow who is trying to recite. But it makes
the rest of the class grin like deaths-heads. Harvard
knows no general plan for cultivating the imagination,
inciting animation, or furthering ambition. All
is suppression, fear; and this repression often finds
vent in rowdyism outside of Harvard Yard. The
seven youths who under Professor Hill mark the
themes hunt only for errors and lapses. The tendency
of this negation is intellectual torpor and spiritual death.</p>

<p>If any one should ask Mr. Barrett Wendell what
he thought of the Herbartian idea of developing the
God within, the Assistant Professor would first calmly
light a cigarette, and after blowing the smoke
through his nose, would fix on his presumptious interlocutor
an Antarctic stare that would freeze him stiff.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>And let me say right here that toward Harvard’s
teachers I bear no malice. In showing Professor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
Hill’s books to be puerile and profitless, and in depositing
the Heir-Apparent in the ragbag of oblivion,
I have no sinister motive. And if from this time forward
their names are a byword and a hissing, it is
only because the Institution which they serve has
stood in the way of Eternal Truth. These professors
of rhetoric prospecting on the mountain side,
thinking they had found the Final Word, builded
tabernacles and rested—all forgetful of the avalanche.</p>

<p>“Clearness” is never found in literature of the
first class. Clearness, according to the Professor,
means a simplicity that makes the meaning plain to
all others. But this is only pabulum for the sophomore
intellect; and outside of Bryant &amp; Stratton’s it
has no legitimate place. The great writer is only
clear to himself or those as great as he.</p>

<p>The masterpieces of Art are all cloud-capped.
Few men indeed ever reach the summit: we watch
them as they ascend and we lose them in the mists as
they climb: sometimes they never come back to us,
and even if they do, having been on the Mount of
Transfiguration, they are no longer ours.</p>

<p>In all great literature there is this large, airy impersonal
independence. The Mountain does not
go to you: you may famish out there on the arid
plain and your bones whiten amid the alkali in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
glistening sun, but the majestic Mountain looks on
imperturbable. The valleys are there, with the rich
verdure, and the running brooks where the trout
frolic, and the cool springs where wild game gathers,
but what cares the Mountain for you! Ecclesiastes
offers no premiums to readers, Shakespeare makes no
appeal to club raisers, Emerson puts forth no hot endeavor
for a million subscribers: all these can do
without you.</p>

<p>Rich lodes run through this Mountain, and we continually
delve and toil for treasure. And in spite of
the pain and isolation and the privation that is incident,
and the dangerous crevices that lie in wait, we
secure a reward for our labor. Still we do not find
the fabled “pockets” that we seek—it is always
something else. From Columbus searching for a
Northwest Passage to the rustic swain who follows
with such fidelity the wake of a petticoat, all are the
sport of Fate. We achieve, but die in ignorance of
the extent to which we have benefitted the Race.
And like the man who rode the hobby all his life,
and whose friends discovered after he was dead that
it was a real horse and had carried the man many
long miles, so are we carried on steeds that are guided
by an Unseen Hand.</p>

<p>All sublime Art is symbolistic. What is the message
the great violinist brings you? Ah, you cannot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
impart it! Each must hear it for himself. The note
that is “clear” to all is not Art. When Charles
Lamb pointed to the row of ledgers in the office of
the East India Company and said, “These are my
works,” he was only joking; for he afterward explained
that ledgers, indices, catalogues, directories,
almanacs, reports, and briefs are not literature at all.
These things inspire no poems; they give no glow.</p>

<p>The province of Art is not to present a specific
message, but to impart a feeling. If we go home
from the Lyceum hushed, treading on air, we have
heard Oratory, even though we cannot recall a single
sentence; and if we read a poem that brings the unbidden
tears and makes the room seem a sacred chancel,
we have read Literature. The Master has imparted
to our spirits a tithe of his own sublimity of
soul.</p>

<p>For the good old ladies who prick the Bible for a
message I have a profound sympathy: the Sacred
Page fits man’s every mood, and this is why it is immortal.
That which is clear is ephemeral. Symbolism
requires interpreters, and lo! colleges spring up with
no other intent than to train men to explain a Book;
for the Saviours of the world all speak in parables.
They see the significance of Things and voice a various
language. The interpreter makes the symbolist
immortal, and the symbolist makes the fame of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
interpreter. If Turner had been “clear,” Ruskin
might still be Assistant Professor. All Holy Writ
from Moses to Whitman is mystical. The writer has
breathed into its nostrils the breath of life, that impalpable,
elusive Something which we forever seek
and which forever escapes us.</p>

<p>Of course, I would not have a writer endeavor to
be mystical—this would be positively base; but I
would have each man who feels that he has something
to say express himself in his own way, without
let, hindrance, or injunction from writers on rhetoric,
who having never produced anything to speak of
themselves, yet are willing for jingling coin to show
others how.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>“What do you do when you are preaching and
can’t think of anything to say?” asked a Fledgeling
of his pastor.</p>

<p>“I just holler,” was the answer of the experienced
Exhorter.</p>

<p>With half a million preachers in the United States,
with families to keep on an average salary of five
hundred dollars, I do not blame them for “hollerin’;”
neither do I censure editors who have to fill
three columns each day if they often “holler;” as
an economist I might advise a man to “holler,” but
as a lover of literature I cannot conscientiously do so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span></p>

<p>I have a clerical friend who, being much before the
public, is often called upon unexpectedly to reduce
moral calculi. Being a man of force, and not a man
of power, he never says, “I do not know,” but always
boldly faces the problem after this manner:
“My friends, this subject naturally divides itself under
three heads: firstly,”... Here he states
some general commonplace for the first head, and
casts about in his mind for the other two; having secured
them, he launches forth with much emphasis
on some other theme and carries all before him.
His swashing and marshal manner makes him everywhere
a great success; he is considered one of the
most powerful men in his denomination.</p>

<p>And I am fully convinced that a painstaking show
of system is one of the first essentials in making a
favorable impression. We are like the Hebrew salesman
who called on a firm who occupied a sixth floor
and who, on starting to show his samples, was
promptly kicked down stairs; having arrived at the
first landing a second man took him in hand and
kicked him one flight further; this was continued
until his battered form reached the sidewalk, when
he picked himself up and admiringly exclaimed,
“Mein Gott! vot a system!” So when a rhetorician
flashes his “heads” and “divisions” and syllogisms
and analyses and figures (that do not lie)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
upon us, we are so lost in bedazzled admiration that
we can only lift up our hands and say, “My God!
what a system!”</p>

<p>Good work never comes from the effort to be
“clear” or “forceful” or “elegant.” Clear to
whom, forsooth? and as for force, it has no more
place in letters than has speed.</p>

<p>Power in Art there surely is, but power is quite a
different thing from force. Power is that quality by
which change is wrought; it means potentiality, potency.
The artist uses only a fraction of his power,
and works his changes by the powder that he never
explodes; while force means movement, action, exertion,
violence, compulsion.</p>

<p>Literature is largely the result of feeling. The
“hustler” is a man of force; very, very seldom is
he a man of power; still rarer is it that he is a man
of feeling. The very idea of force precludes tender
sensibility and delicate emotion. If I should write
on a scrap of paper, “Hate is death, but love is
life,” and drop the slip into the street, there might
be power in the words, but surely there is no force.</p>

<p>And as for elegance, let him who attempts it leave
all hope behind; he is already damned. The elegance
of an act must spring unconsciously from the
gracious soul within. There is no formula.</p>

<p>In letters, “clearness” should be left to the maker<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
of directories, “force” to the auctioneer, and “elegance”
to the young man who presides at the button
counter. Were I an instructor in a Commercial College,
I might advise that in business correspondence
there should be clearness and force and elegance; but
if I were a Professor of Literature and Oratory, I would
not smother inspiration in a formula. I would say,
Cultivate the heart and intellect, and allow nature to
do the rest. For while it is still a mooted question
whether a man’s offspring after the flesh are heirs to
his mental and spiritual qualities, it is very sure that
the children of his brain are partakers in whatsoever
virtue that his soul possesses.</p>

<p>The teacher who teaches best is not he who insists
on our memorizing rules, but he who produces in the
pupil a pleasurable animation. We learn only in
times of joy and in times of grief. The teacher who
can give his pupils pleasure in their work shall be
crowned with laurel, but grief—grief is the unwelcome
gift of the gods alone!</p>

<p>Let the writer have a clear conception and then
express it so it is at the moment clear to his Other-Self—that
Self that looks on over the shoulder of
every man, endorsing or censuring his every act and
thought and deed. The highest reward of good
work consists in the approbation of this Other-Self,
and in that alone; even though the world flouts it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
all, you have not failed. “I know what pleasure
is,” said Stevenson, “for I have done good work.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SHAKSPEARES_BORROWINGS">SHAKSPEARE’S BORROWINGS.</h2>

</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-a.jpg" width="50" height="60" alt="">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">An English student of Italian literature has been
at great pains to investigate Mr. William
Shakspeare’s indebtedness for his plots and backgrounds
to the Italian novelists. He publishes the
result of his studies in the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>, and
it is an article all students of literature will want to
read. It reveals the fine audacity of Mr. Shakspeare,
and shows how the world of readers gains when
great genius takes its own where it finds it.</p>

<p>These Italian novelists were fine workmen, and ingenious
story tellers, but Shakspeare clothed their
creations in the flesh and blood of perennial humanity.
They made the puppets of passion, true to the fashions
and humors of their day, and invaluable as such;
Shakspeare took them and gave them that philosophy
and humanity that rings true through all the
changes of custom, and knowledge and philosophy.</p>

<p>These writers had the faculty of invention, of incident
and situation, and dramatic movement and
climax. Shakspeare may have really lacked these
ingenious faculties of mind, but yet he had the dramatic
perception of life—the whole of life, quick and
stirring, all emotion and thought and passion. In his
day the play was the thing in England, and he needed
a strong current of human action to show the soul of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
life on the stage as he saw it in the commonplaces of
everyday existence. So he borrowed from the Italians,
who supplied him with the very plots he needed to
develop his own philosophy of life, in a fashion
that gave thought its real place in life, as a concrete
force on a level with action.</p>

<p>If the novel had been established in England
earlier, if the English writers had borrowed the form
of the novel from the Italians bodily, instead of their
plots, Shakspeare might have been our psychological
novelist; for it seems that his dramatic power was of
the deeper sort that seizes the heart and soul of life,
rather than that which devises effective scenes and
climaxes. That is, if this English writer is to be
trusted, and he seems to write with authority. He
says <i>Cymbeline</i> and <i>All’s Well That Ends Well</i> were
taken from Boccaccio’s <i>Decameron</i>, <i>The Merchant of
Venice</i> and <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i> from
Florentino’s <i>Pecarone</i>, <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, <i>Much Ado
about Nothing</i>, <i>Two Gentlemen of Verona</i> and <i>Twelfth
Night</i> from Bandello, and <i>Measure for Measure</i> and
<i>Othello</i> from Giraldi’s <i>Ecatommiti</i>.</p>

<p>If any contemporary writer put himself in such indebtedness
the critics would probably howl. And
yet the richest imaginations, the most fantastic fancy,
the keenest wit and widest comprehension of human
nature and life is often given to a writer who is destitute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
of the mere dramatic knack of improvising a
story to carry on the frame of life as he knows and
sees it.</p>

<p>Half our so-called creative and imaginative writers
of today are merely ingenious plot and puppet makers,
with no real gift of creation or imagination at all.
The exceptions in English are Meredith, Hardy,
Zangwill, Gissing and a baker’s dozen or so others.
The man of real imaginative gifts, and the philosophic
insight that invariably accompanies them, is seldom
recognized in his true office and capacity; for he so
often lacks the melodramatic and theatrical ingenuity,
that perverts the course of human destiny for mere
effectiveness. Since the deeper things of existence
are usually excluded from fiction it is ten to one he is
writing criticism or essays, and is thought to be prosy
and dull by the majority of readers, to whom imaginative
writing means simply the romance of abducted
duchesses and bloody encounters by moonlight. But
creation, as Emerson pointed out long ago, is <i>insight</i>.</p>

<p>A gory era is at this hour upon us. Let us hope
that the true imaginative literature of insight, philosophy,
poetry and analysis of character will yet
emerge, when Ibsen and Maeterlinck and Sudermann
and the rest are relieved by process of time of
the stigma attached to all original observers, thinkers
and innovators.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span></p>

<p>Shakespeare, if he were alive today, would be in
the forefront of this new movement for freedom in
literature, and he would steal right and left from
Science!</p>

<p class="dropcap">Ah! I am late this morning. I can feel in the
air the vibration of the third hour. Attius!
Attius! I suppose he thinks that having lain so long,
I may as well wait till tomorrow. Ah! Attius, have
you, too, overslept yourself? No more dinners with
Maecenas: we are getting too old for them. It is
the third hour; I will rise. But first request Livia
Augusta to favor me with her presence. Dear old
Attius! that little trick of telling him the hour never
fails. Now for my daily bargain with the august.</p>

<p>Madam, good morning; leave us, Attius. And
how is the irreproachable? Judging from her roses,
better than her lacy deputy. I spare you the econium
of Maecenas’ wine. I saw last night a girl named
Candidia; do you know who she is? Oh, the old
senator’s daughter? Not much like him; I should
have said our late friend, Mark Antony, was a friend
of the family. You know that? I thought she had
a trick of him, and I don’t often make that sort of
mistake. She’s a very fine young woman, the white<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
Cantonia. I suppose you know all about her; is she
desirous of influence at Court? H’m! Thanks; I
trust you to awake her to the legitimate ambition of
a Roman beauty. I wish, Incomparable, you’d find
a Maecenas to renasce Roman women. When Candidia
stands up you can see she is standing on her
legs, and, except a certain perennial of mine, I can’t
say as much for any woman else in Rome. Will you
see about it? Thanks, kindest of Junos.</p>

<p>Now, another matter. You must see by now,
Livia, that it’s impossible for me to let Tiberius go
on any longer as he’s doing. You must let me send
him away. Yes, yes; I know all you’ve done for
me, but it doesn’t justify your son in studied insolence.
After all I’m supposed to be Proconsul and
Pontiff and Augustus, and all that, and I can’t let
him do it. Claudian pride? Well, I can only say
that there’s no vacancy for Claudian pride in Rome
just at present. Eh? What has Candidia to do
with Tiberius? Oh, I see; you want to bargain.
Very well, Candidia for Tiberius—only on these conditions.
First, you must talk to him seriously about
his demeanor—not as coming from me, you understand.
Secondly, I put him on the list for foreign
service. Oh, yes, you can make your mind easy.
He shall have a big war, and a triumph, and all the
fandangles. Also, I’ll throw in Agrippa; he shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
go abroad and have no triumph, and I’ll try to keep
Julia quiet. I’m a generous Jove—eh, Junicula?
Give me a kiss, old wench. We’ve had some battering
times together, eh? And if I’m not mistaken
you’ve still something to hold your back straight on,
eh? Eh? Eh? Adieu, my Empress. Send in Cleobulus,
will you? And don’t forget Candidia—H’m.</p>

<p>My excellent spouse was pleased with my little
attentions. Also she was pleased with the idea of
her Tiberius in high command; she doesn’t yet understand
the value of interior lines in politics, my Augusta.
I suppose she foresees her Tiberius crossing
the Rubicon while we all sit tremulous in East
Aurora—ha, ha! And yet she’s seen the Praetorians
at drill every day these many years. Naturalists
have greatly neglected women.</p>

<p>Now, Cleobulus, my wig and my eye-brightening
stuff. I always assume you don’t give away these
secrets of the toilet, Cleobulus. If you do, the next
wig will be the scalp of one Cleobulus, mysteriously
disappeared. Now the gown. Not that, you nincompoop
of genius. How often must I tell you I’m
only plain Proconsul? That will do: now announce
me at the levee. I wonder who’s here today. I’m
glad the Roman Senators haven’t the political insight
of that hair-dresser.</p>

<p>Attius, precede me into the ante-chamber, while I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
have a look at the company. Gods, what an air the
rogue has with him, and how very right he is, considering
the way they grovel to him. A poor set of
curs, I’m afraid, these nobles at Rome; yet I’m
afraid I like them.</p>

<p>Good day, gentlemen, I fear I have ill repaid this
courteous attention by keeping you so long awaiting.
Ah, Isauricus, my dear old friend, this is too kind.
Too kind; it is I that should be calling on you; you
must not expose yourself to this morning air; all
Rome is waiting for your speech on this new Land
Bill or Agrippa’s. By the way, Egnatius, I do not
think you have yet taken the public into confidence
as to your attitude? You reserve it? Ha! I am
not sure you are right, if I may say so. One loses
a great part of one’s due influence, I always think,
unless one gives an opinion time to percolate, as one
might say. I have told Agrippa frankly all along
that I shall oppose him on the municipal clauses.
What says Piso? Opposed to the whole scheme;
you will speak, of course?</p>

<p>Aha, good day, Iulus. What says Iulus on the
question of the hour? An excellent measure all
around! So—well, it should be an interesting debate,
and personally I am still open to be convinced.
And here is the author of all the trouble, himself.
How do you do, Agrippa? Eh? A word in private;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
by all means, old man. Want to go away? No,
no, dear fellow, we want you here. Pannonia and
Germany? Nonsense, you’re losing your nerve.
Why, we settled the Pannonians years ago. Well,
we’ll think it over.</p>

<p>Good morning, Maecenas; survived your own
wine, I see! Amusing fellow, that little Horace of
yours. Underbred? No, I didn’t notice it. I tell
you what, though, if I were that man I wouldn’t
stand the way you treat him for five minutes, good
as your dinners are. However, that’s his affair.
Been here long? I’m beginning to agree with you
about Iulus. See me before dinner.</p>

<p>Well, gentlemen, I thank you once more for the
high honor you have paid me. I am afraid you
spoil me with your indulgence, for I am now about
to ask to be excused. You have put me in an important
public position, and I am anxious not to
disappoint you. Adieu, my friends.</p>

<p>H’m. To-day’s hypocrisy over. Not that it is,
though, for I have to play the hypocrite one way
and another every minute of my life. I’m beginning
to think it’s a mistake to be a tyrant. It’s exciting
enough when you have to fight for it; but when
you’ve got it, decidedly a bore. And unluckily the
posing isn’t the worst of it; the worst of it is that
you have to suppress so many good fellows. Now I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
know Egnatius is guilty of the impiety of not seeing
why he should do what I please any more than I
should do what he pleases. I must get rid of him;
I can’t help myself. Such a witty, astute fellow,
too, and what a boxer! Iulus I must get rid of, too.
I fancy Maecenas has got his own reasons for wanting
Iulus out of the way; still he is his father’s son,
and never quite safe. A man I’ve known since they
first put me into the long gown. No, I sha’n’t get
rid of Iulus; he can go to Gyarus if Maecenas likes.
No, dam it, why Gyarus? He won’t do any harm
at Rhodes, and at least he can get a dinner there.
Poor old Iulus! And poor old Agrippa! I suppose
he wants to go away because, he can’t stand Julia
any more. I should never mind that sort of scandal
myself, but some do. Perhaps I was to blame in
giving him Julia at all, knowing her character. But
she had to marry somebody and that somebody could
be none else than Agrippa. Such is statesmanship!
Now the poor old boy wants to go back to his soldiers.
But I can’t do it. Once he gets to Pannonia, he’d forget
his obedience—and he is most astonishingly
obedient—and go for the chiefs. His loyalty’s splendid,
but I can’t trust even it, when the old war-horse
sees the enemy in front of him. And the worst of it
is that the chiefs ought to be smashed this summer,
and no man in the world could do it as well as Agrippa.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
It would be all over in a month. But Pannonia’s
got to be nursed, for Pannonia’s to be a big thing,
and Tiberius is to get his triumph for it, sulky dog.
Yet he’s got the stuff in him, too. I suppose I’d
better make up some reason to send Agrippa to Gaul
again: Livia can’t object to him there. After all,
the real devil of it isn’t being a tyrant, but being a
married tyrant. There isn’t an easier or pleasanter
thing in the whole world than to go on as I’m doing
now, and keep my place to the end, and my friends
into the bargain. It’s this cursed dynasty business,
and that cursed woman—though she’s behaved a
deuced deal better to me than I deserved. But why
in the name of all the gods at once must I turn out
my oldest friend to die miserable in Gaul? Why, to
make the way easy for a moody young prig that I
dislike—and who hates me. What do I get for it
all? Candidia! That’s what it comes to, when you
work it out. I’m monarch of the world, and the
gain of it is that I have unequaled chances of making
a ridiculous goddam goat of myself. I wish to
Heaven I’d had my uncle’s pluck: then I should
have been cut to pieces ten years ago. Still after all,
Agrippa’s going to Gaul would be away out of the
Land Bill business, and I begin to think I went too
far in the matter. Yes: he had better go.</p>

<p class="dropcap">I have been greatly amused quite recently by
two little items that were printed in one of those
short-lived magazinelets. One article was by Neith
Boyce and the other by Emma Eggleson, both of
which ladies are subscribers to <i>The Homely Ladies
Journal</i>. If I am not mistaken one of these ladies
raised a club for the <i>Journal</i> (not at it), and when
Mr. Curtis and me offered to send her abroad to be
educated, the amusing fact was discovered that she
already had a lovely education.</p>

<p>But the articles that amused me so much were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
about the penchant of editors to monkey with manuscript.
Both articles were on the same theme, but
the article by Neith Boyce was the longest. As Mr.
Howells has not improperly spoken of one of Neith
Boyce’s short stories as a crackerjack, and as this
master of letters has also referred to a poem by
Emma Eggleson as hotstuff, I feel that I am justified
in saying that both of these ladies are arriving successward
in the merry and dizzy field of literature
very rapidly.</p>

<p>I have sometimes thought in my thoughtful way
that the reason an editor is called by that appellation
is because he loves to edit. A young literary aspirant
told me of a case in point the other day. He
wrote a lovely triolet which was accepted on its
seventeenth trip by a paper which shall be nameless.
When he sent it out it ran thus:</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">A nosegay of roses white,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Stands on my loved one’s table.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is how it was printed:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent2">Upon my loved one’s table.</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">And deck her tresses sable—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That is if I were able.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>You see much of the poetic effluvia was lost when
it had been edited.</p>

<p>A very witty novelist, author of a novel, by the
way, said an awfully bright thing to me the other
day. He was speaking of the way that certain
houses had of sending you a postal saying your manuscript
would receive attention. “That,” said he,
“keys you up to concert pitch. But there isn’t any
concert generally. Your manuscript is refunded:
that’s all.” I had to laugh, it was so witty.</p>

<p>A well known poet told me the other day that an
editor should be a judge of good poetry. Said he,
“when an editor cuts two or three lines out of your
sonnet to a wild flower or a wild animal, or anything
whatever, and retains the distinguishing label, it is
like passing off XX milk for the XXX article and the
real connoisseur is justly indignant. An honest and
self respecting poet wishes to give full measure in
his sonnets and it is an injury to his moral character
that the editor works when he palms off ten or a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
dozen for the usual fourteen or fifteen lines of a
sonnet.”</p>

<p>Poets are not practical. Why didn’t he write that
out himself and sell it for a dollar a line instead of
giving me the chance?</p>

<p>I’m an editor myself in a small way.</p>

<p>I ask celebrated authors, actors, preachers, presidents,
doctors, lawyers, generals, naval officers and
the like to send in any old thing they happen to have
on the hook and then I have it beautifully illustrated
and print it just as it is; no matter how bad it is, I
never change a line. It’s a matter of principal—not
to say of interest. For above all things I wish to be
honest and successful.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco6.jpg" alt=""> Dr. Robertson Nicoll, of London, England, a good
Scot, is the present day discoverer of Scotch genius,
and Ian Maclaren is largely the creation of his splendid
audacity of prophecy and executive ability.</p>

<p>Dr. Nicoll is a noticeable and interesting personality
in contemporary literature. He fully deserves
his wide celebrity, for he has put into the chronicling
of monotonous literary news and criticism an element
of newsyness and vim that is characteristic of the best
American journalism. He has made mere literary news
as exciting and mysterious as politics or horseracing.
We now bet on the sales of new poets as well as on
the Derby favorites. This adds a great deal to the
picturesqueness and interest of “The Literary Show,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
and Dr. Nicoll deserves the credit due to a bold innovator.
He marks an epoch in literary journalism,
and his “Scotch era” will be remembered in history.
But fashions change and Ian Maclaren, and some of
Dr. Nicoll’s other inventions and discoveries, will
pass into well deserved oblivion, in a very little while.</p>

<p>They are significant simply as striking examples of
the creative genius of criticism. As “famous authors”
they are purely factitious. In a word, they must be
considered at par amply as the shadows and phantoms
of Dr. Nicoll’s picturesque power of criticism
and great creative gifts.</p>

<p>The literature of the Kailyard is having its day,
but happily it will not last forever. It will eventually
go the way of negro dialect fiction, when its unique
adaptability as a conveyance for the perfectly obvious
and the perfectly absurd come to be more generally
recognized than is possible in this hour of perfervid
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>All the Scots who want to be in the Scotch Sweepstakes
and win, had better mount their nags in this
hour of favor and get away. A few discerning and
canny critics are still alive, and the suspicion is gaining
ground among them from a perusal of Ian Maclaren’s
pages, that the great literary prophet of
Paternoster-Row, while a delightful chroniqueur and
a generous soul, is not altogether an infallible judge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
of the permanent and essential elements of robust and
distinctive literature.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco6.jpg" alt=""> The one man of the Nineteenth Century who will
be remembered when all others are forgotten, and
whose name will go clattering down the Corridors of
Time like a tin kettle to a dog’s tail, is Professor J.
Dorman Steele. This man covers all Science and all
Philosophy. He has compiled text books on seventeen
subjects and over three million volumes of his
works have been sold. Darwin, Humboldt, Spencer,
Huxley—all fade into misty nothingness when we
think of Steele, and bless my soul! what a suggestive
name that is anyway!!</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco6.jpg" alt=""> The <i>Forum</i> for March had an article concerning

Boors,” just as if every one did not know only too
well what they were already. I understand that
nearly half of the edition was run before the mistake
was discovered.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco6.jpg" alt=""> So far no charge has been made that the Philistines
were mixing up in the theatrical business; but on
every hand the air is full of complaints because the
stage has fallen into the hands of the Children of
Israel. Even Mr. Howells has turned <i>Harper’s
Weekly</i> into a Periodical of Protest, and declares
that the greed for dollars has dropped histrionics to a
point where the drama is not only artistically decadent
but positively demoralizing.</p>

<p>But a friend of mine takes issue with Silas Lapham
and declares that there is a sure reaction just
now in favor of plays with a strong ethical purpose.
To prove his point he cites a certain curtain raiser
called <i>The Flea Hunt</i>.</p>

<p>The scene opens, in this choice little fantasy, on the
<i>ennui</i> of a pretty young woman, whose husband, a
sea captain, is far across the water. The afternoons
pass slowly for her; she cannot read and tosses on
her boudoir lounge distressfully. To add to her uneasiness
a young man across the way has had the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
impudence to send her flowers and a note, with a
rendezvous for 3 o’clock. Indignation. Pride of
conscious strength. Admiration. Curiosity. Hesitation.
Remorse. Prayers to her husband’s portrait.
Sighs. Wriggles. Pillowtossing. Thoughtfulness.</p>

<p>The clock strikes 2. <i>Zut!</i> She starts up guiltily,
tiptoes across the room, and turns her husband’s picture
to the wall. Now she is in a tempest of preparation
with her street toilette. The time is growing
short. She has her gloves, her hat, her cloak, her
muff, her veil, her parasol, and stands at the open door
to give a last apologetic look. Ouch! What is that!
Can it be! Ouch! again. Certainly a flea is biting her
neck—she reaches for it! Then the trouble begins.
In the search for the nimble flea nearly everything the
lady has on is cast aside. At last she finds it. But
by this time she has revealed a very roly-poly tenement
of clay with a center of gravity like a sofa pillow.
Lingerie is strewn over chairs, tables, sofa and floor.
She is clad only in very scanty, but dainty dimity.
The clock is striking 3. Too late! she looks at
the flea, first revengefully, then thoughtfully, then
gratefully. Hesitatingly she slips across the room
and turns her husband’s portrait to the light.
Saved—providentially saved, saved by a flea!

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco6.jpg" alt=""> In 1859 there lived three miles north-east of Skowhegan
an Old Farmer, and he subscribed for the
New York <i>Tribune</i>. The reason he subscribed was
because the Editor, one Horace Greely, wrote Hot
Stuff. Now the Old Farmer was a great admirer of
Mr. Greely and of the Hot Stuff and he induced several
of his neighbors to subscribe for the <i>Tribune</i>
on account of the Hot Stuff and the greatness of Mr.
Greely. Now it chanced that Mr. Greely wrote on
many themes and on a certain day he produced Hot
Stuff on a certain subject about which no man should
write unless he has had a Call. When the Old Farmer
read that particular editorial he was very wroth
and he wrote a very angry personal letter to Mr.
Greely, cancelling his subscription; and he also induced
his neighbors to cancel theirs.</p>

<p>About a year after this the Old Farmer went to
Skowhegan with a load of slipperyellum, and walking
into a grocery he found the Grocer reading the New
York <i>Tribune</i>. The Old Farmer started, stared,
and exclaimed, “What er—eh—what er that paper
you be readin’?”</p>

<p>“The New York <i>Tribune</i>,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“My! Judas Priest—that can’t be—me and three
other fellows ordered it stopped a year ago!”</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco6.jpg" alt=""> I hear that an article by Mr. Cudahy is soon to
appear in <i>The Ladies Home Journal</i>. The subject is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>

he would be a greater if he never used in print those
tattered and attenuated expressions, “so to speak”

to tell us that Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett
were married “in September of 1866.” And
then in the next column “on March 9th, 1869, was
born their son.” If James Russell Lowell were alive
today I can imagine him saying, “I may be a bookman,
but by the eternal I’m not the kind issued by
Dodd, Mead &amp; Company.”</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco6.jpg" alt=""> Way &amp; Williams, Chicago, the publishers of Mrs.
Wynne’s book, <i>The Little Room and Other Stories</i>,

known on application.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco6.jpg" alt=""> “Should we have an Eleventh Commandment?”
asked a youth of the Greatest Living Actress. “Most
assuredly, no—we have ten too many now!” answered
the divine Sara.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco6.jpg" alt=""> The fact that we have no “serving class” in
America, and that some of us (or you) have wealth
and insist on being waited upon, is a stream of tendency
that makes for misery. The wives of very
many of our rich men make a business of keeping
up an establishment. They are not producers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
in any sense, and their one excuse for living is
put out of court when we consider that “society” to
them means neither affinity nor friendship. Their
woes are in exact proportion to the number of servants
that play tennis with their peace of mind. Or,
more strictly speaking, the size of the house,
showing the bigness of their cares, their happiness
is in inverse ratio to the square of the domicile.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco6.jpg" alt=""> Writers who can gain an audience in a foreign
and distant country reap some of the advantages of
the cool and impartial interest of posterity. The
English authors enjoy this advantage, and something
more with the contemporary American reading public;
but the English critics and public do not reciprocate
our hospitality and impartiality in any degree,
though there is a reported demand in England for
American text books on electric lighting and improved
methods of agriculture.</p>

<p>However, the future of the English speaking race
is with us on this continent, and in Australia and
in Africa, and so certain characteristics of the English
mind and English literature will be remolded and
touched and broadened by other racial influences.
They have already been so modified and changed
here since Emerson’s day. So, eventually, instead
of Americans looking obsequiously over to Paternoster
Row and Fleet street in all intellectual concerns,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
England will shrink into a small and insignificant
provincial community, cut off from the rest of the
race and its great centres of thought. Modern civilization
will upset all the traditions of the old intellectual
centres by making new ones. Thus our
posterity will have a revenge on British condescension
we can only enjoy in anticipatory imaginings.
I wish I could live as long as Methusaleh to be
alive then. England and English’ literature will
perhaps finally hold the importance of the Provencal
literature in France—it will be an archaic survival in
the midst of the great throbbing heart of a great
modern people. Our descendants will roar over our
adulation of English female theological novelists.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco6.jpg" alt=""> The <i>Chip-Munk</i> “Notes” are all long past due;
and most depressing to contemplate. It was after
trying to make sense of them that Ella Wheeler

benefit of the Hivites, the Moabites, the Hittites and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
the Parasites: A nice young man in Scranton called
on a nice young lady and spent the evening. When
he arrived there was not a cloud in the sky, so he
carried no umbrella and wore neither goloshes nor
mackintosh. At ten o’clock when he arose to go, it
was raining cats and dogs; the gutters o’erflowed
and if it had been in Johnstown, it could properly
have been called a Johnstown flood.</p>

<p>“My, my, my!” said the nice young lady, “if
you go out in all this storm you will catch your
death a’ cold!”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I might!” was the trembling answer.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you what—stay all night; you
can have Tom’s room, since he’s at college. Yes,
occupy Tom’s room—excuse me a minute and I’ll
just run up and see if it’s in order.”</p>

<p>The young lady flew gracefully up the stairs to see
that Tom’s room was in order. In five minutes
she came down to announce that Tom’s room was
in order, but no Charles was in sight. Like old
Clangingharp, he had passed out—no one knew where
or how. But in a very few moments he appeared,
very dripping and out of breath from running, a bundle
in a newspaper under his arm.</p>

<p>“Why, Charles, where have you been?” was his
greeting.</p>

<p>“Been home after my night shirt,” was the reply.</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
